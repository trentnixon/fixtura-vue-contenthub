## Overview

Fixed critical bug preventing users from accessing the edit page via direct URL navigation.

## Completion Summary

Resolved issue where direct navigation to edit URLs failed because `selectedFixturaAsset` wasn't populated. Updated `useFixturaAsset` composable to fetch asset data from route query parameters. Normalized all asset type lookups to lowercase by converting component mapping keys to lowercase in both `processEdit.vue` and `HeaderSection.vue`. Users can now access edit pages directly via URL and see proper asset titles.

## Overview

Fixed JSON parsing error in VideoMetaDataEdit component during initial render.

## Completion Summary

Resolved JSON parsing error that occurred when `VideoMetaDataEdit` component tried to parse undefined `videoMeta` prop. Added null checks before JSON operations and conditional rendering in template to prevent errors during data loading. Component now safely handles undefined props during the initial fetch phase.
